  # Add additional themes here. In the case where multiple themes match a route, the first one
  # in this list will get priority. It is advisable to always have a theme that matches
  # every route as the last one

  # # handle, and all collections and/or items within it
  # - name: custom
  #   handle: 10673/1233

  # # A theme with a regex property will match the route using a regular expression. If it
  # # matches the route for a community or collection it will also apply to all collections
  # # and/or items within it
